## Description

This project is a **frontend React application** styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It demonstrates a **clean, modular UI** using **small reusable components**, **props**, and **destructuring**.  

The project follows the **Atomic Design methodology**, organizing components into **Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, and Sections** for better maintainability and scalability.  

The main UI features **horizontally scrollable cards** with high-quality images, numeric headings, descriptive text, and buttons with dynamic background colors. Scrollbars are hidden for a polished look, and smooth horizontal scrolling improves user experience.
